# Specification Quality Checklist: Workflow Router

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Ready to proceed to `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Key scope boundary in Assumptions: the router selects workflows but does NOT invoke them
  directly — handoff to an invocation layer is out of scope for this spec. This boundary
  should be validated with the user before planning begins.
- Dependency chain: `003-hook-context-parser` provides the input contract (hook context)
  this router consumes.
- Configuration file format (YAML/TOML/JSON) is deferred to planning per Assumptions.
